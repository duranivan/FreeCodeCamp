            <ul>
              <li><strong>1777</strong> - Born in Braunschweig, Germany.</li>
              <li><strong>1791</strong> - Starts receiving financial support from the Duke of Brunswick.</li>
              <li><strong>1795</strong> - Joins the University of Göttingen.</li
              >
              <li><strong>1801</strong> - Publishes <em>'Disquisitiones Arithmeticae'</em>, the foundamental work of algebraic number theory, at the age of 21.</li>
              <li><strong>1805</strong> - Marries Johanna Osthoff.</li>
              <li><strong>1807</strong> - Accepts position at Göttingen, where he would be in charge of the new observatory, with no teaching duties.</li>
              <li><strong>1809</strong> - Marries Minna Waldeck, after his first wife's death in the same year.</li>
              <li><strong>1812</strong> - Starts his work on elliptic integrals, the arithmetic-geometric mean, and hypergeometric functions.</li>
              <li><strong>1818</strong> - Starts directing personally the geodetic survey of the Kingdom of Hanover. This leads to his publication <em>'Determination of the latitude difference between Göttingen and Altona'</em> (1828), which includes a development of the theory of least-squares fitting of data (linear regression).</li>
              <li><strong>1823</strong> - Wins the Copenhagen Prize Essay- general conformality criterion for mapping between two arbitrary surfaces, using the Cauchy-Riemann equations.</li>
              <li><strong>1828</strong> - Publishes <em>'General investigations on curved surfaces'</em>, Gauss’s main work on differential geometry. Introduces the `Gaussian curvature’ and the program of investigating intrinsic differential geometry.</li>
              <li><strong>1831</strong> - Wilhelm Weber joins the Göttingen faculty as professor of physics; this marks the beginning of Gauss’s systematic research in physics, especially potential theory.</li>
              <li><strong>1832</strong> - Starts his research on terrestrial magnetism, encouraged by Weber and Alexander v. Humboldt.</li>
              <li><strong>1838</strong> - Develops, together with Weber, the first functioning electromagnetic telegraph.</li>
              <li><strong>1855</strong> - Dies in Göttingen, Germany.</li>

              <p>"The best that Gauss has given us was likewise an exclusive production. If he had not created his geometry of surfaces, which served Riemann as a basis, it is scarcely conceivable that anyone else would have discovered it. I do not hesitate to confess that to a certain extent a similar pleasure may be found by absorbing ourselves in questions of pure geometry."</p>
